# LoL Analytics Aggregator Chat Logs

## Conversation Context
This file includes the full dialogue between the user and ChatGPT, focused on the design, architecture, debugging, and finalization of a League of Legends analytics dashboard project.

---

## Topics Covered

- Riot API details and JSON structure
- Flask backend and routing
- API key security and `.env` usage
- Frontend design and Plotly visualizations
- Component-based time series and bar charts
- Aggregation types (champion, role, win/loss)
- User query form handling and data loading
- Index.html rendering quirks with Jinja and JavaScript
- Modular separation of data pipeline and visualization logic
- Bug resolution (timestamp, `NoneType`, JSON loading, file not found)
- HTML tab separation per component
- Scrollable layout and UI organization
- README.md, Synopsis.md, and legal considerations

## Summary of Work Completed

-  Designed an app that analyzes LoL matches using Riot's API.
-  Created a Flask backend with API endpoints for live queries and loading saved aggregations.
-  Developed visualizations using Plotly including:
  - Time series graphs per component (gold, xp, cs, level, etc.)
  - Bar charts grouped by game and component
-  Separated visualizations per component into browser tabs for ease of navigation.
-  Implemented user input forms to query summoner, tag, and aggregation type.
-  Fixed rendering bugs related to improper JSON serialization and Jinja script parsing.
-  Implemented support for persistent data storage and retrieval using timestamps and tags.

---

## Developer Notes


- Visualization tabs open in new windows; index page retains query context.
- Aggregation JSON now supports all three types, but only one is rendered at a time.
- Data quality can suffer from early remakes or forfeits â€” this was documented in `Synopsis.md`.
- Project structure is intentionally scalable for future machine learning integration.

## File Info

- **index.html**: Frontend user input and initial data rendering.
- **component_view.html**: Per-component visualization, separated by tab.
- **motherboard.py**: Central Flask controller handling all routes.
- **utils/**: Contains `riot_api.py`, `etl.py`, `aggregators.py`, `file_helpers.py`.
- **static/**: Hosts CSS and Plotly assets.

## Final Steps

-  Confirmed that aggregations and component tabs now work as intended.
-  Data persistence and loading are operational with date and  timestamps.
-  README.md, Synopsis.md, and this chatlog (`chatlogs.md`) have been prepared for project delivery.
